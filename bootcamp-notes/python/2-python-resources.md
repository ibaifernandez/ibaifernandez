# Python (Resources)

[Develop Database-Driven Web Apps with Python, Flask, and MySQL](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/develop-database-driven-web-apps-with-python-flask-and-mysql/

The course is divided into two parts, each with its own set of objectives, covering everything from Flask basics to MySQL database setup, and application deployment.

In Part 1, you will learn how to build and deploy a site using the Flask Python web framework. You will start by creating a "Jovian Careers" website that lists job openings at Jovian.

You will also learn how to use a modern HTML & CSS framework for layout and styling, as well as how to deploy the website to the cloud and attach a custom domain. By the end of Part 1, you will have a working website that is ready to be connected to a database.

In Part 2, you will connect the Flask application from the first part to a cloud MySQL database, and learn how to deploy a production-ready database-driven web application. You will start by setting up the project and deployment, then move on to cloud MySQL database setup, and DB connection with SQLAlchemy.)
