# Ibai Fernández

## Personal Data

-   **Name**: Ibai Fernández
-   **Birth Year**: 1985
-   **Nationality**: Spanish
-   **Residence**: Ecuador (since 2014)
-   **_Motto_**: 'Nulla dies sine linea'

**_Nulla dies sine linea_** is a Latin phrase meaning “no day without a single line”. It finds its source
in Pliny the Elder (_Natural History_, XXXV, 84), where the idea applies to the Greek painter Apelles,
who did not go a day without drawing at least one line. But it is only in the _Proverbiorum libellus_
by Polydore Vergil (1470-1555) in which the phrase itself is attested for the first time.

## Focus

Organized and motivated employee specially focused on time management, capable of working under pressure
in many different environments. Seeking to join an organization where I can make the best out of my potential,
contributing to the organization's growth, as the organization contributes to mine.

## Summary

Highly versatile entrepreneur with 9+ years of experience in setting up self-sustainable businesses and partaking
in corporate environments. Responsible for planning and directing daily operations, coming up with new ideas,
managing conflicts, supervision, sales, customer service, and marketing.

Always with the most positive attitude and ready to help others along the same path that I have chosen, I have
created my theoretical business model, regarding which I am always open to performing any adjustments necessary
based on each venture's particular needs.

Used to working outside the typical workdays, the strongest parts of my skill set are related to time management,
project managing (both planning and decision making), and leadership (for which a strong sense of communication
always comes in quite handy).
