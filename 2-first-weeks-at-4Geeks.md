2. Emmet Abbreviations

## Emmet — the essential toolkit for web-developers

Emmet is a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow.

Basically, most text editors out there allow you to store and re-use commonly used code chunks, called “snippets”. While snippets are a good way to boost your productivity, all implementations have common pitfalls: you have to define the snippet first and you can’t extend them in runtime.

Emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level: you can type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation. Emmet is developed and optimised for web-developers whose workflow depends on HTML/XML and CSS, but can be used with programming languages too.

7. What is ARIA?

   - **ARIA**, also known as **WAI-ARIA**, stands for **_Accessible Rich Internet Applications_**. ARIA defines a variety of markup extensions, usually HTML5 attributes, that can be added to elements to give screen readers more information about the element and help visually-impaired users better grasp what’s happening on the webpage.

8. What are YAML/YML files and what are they used for?

## YAML (in a nutshell)

YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for yet another markup language or YAML ain't markup language (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents.

YAML is a popular programming language because it is human-readable and easy to understand. It can also be used in conjunction with other programming languages.

YAML has features that come from Perl, C, XML, HTML, and other programming languages. YAML is also a superset of JSON, so JSON files are valid in YAML.

YAML uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting. Tab characters are not allowed, so whitespaces are used instead. There are no usual format symbols, such as braces, square brackets, closing tags, or quotation marks. YAML files use a .yml or .yaml extension.

The structure of a YAML file is a map or a list.

Maps allow you to associate key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and the order doesn't matter. Think of a Python dictionary or a variable assignment in a Bash script.
